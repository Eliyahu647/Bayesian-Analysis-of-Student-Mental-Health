# Bayesian Analysis of Student Mental Health üìä 

This project explores the relationship between demographic and academic factors and mental health variables (stress, anxiety, and depression) among university students. Using Bayesian statistical models, we uncover key insights about how these variables interact and impact students' well-being.

## Files in this RepositoryüìÅ 
- **Project Data.csv**: Dataset containing demographic, academic, and mental health information (stress, anxiety, depression scores).
- **Stan Files**:
  - `model_q1.stan`: Examines the effect of gender on depression levels.
  - `model_q2.stan`: Investigates how age, engineering studies, and academic year influence stress and anxiety.
  - `model_q3_1.stan` and `model_q3_2.stan`: Compare predictors of depression with and without stress/anxiety metrics.
  - `posterior_model.stan`: Combines models for advanced posterior predictive checks.

## Research Questionsüîç 

### **1. Gender and Depression**
**Question**: Is there a significant difference in depression levels between men and women?  
**Insights**:
The posterior analysis shows a significant effect of gender on depression levels, indicating that women experience higher levels of depression on average.

### **2. Demographics and Stress/Anxiety**
**Question**: How do age, field of study (engineering vs. non-engineering), and academic year affect stress and anxiety levels?  
**Insights**:
- Younger students tend to report higher stress and anxiety levels.
- Engineering students experience lower stress and anxiety compared to students in other fields.
- Advanced academic years correlate with increased levels of stress and anxiety.

### **3. Improved Prediction of Depression**
**Question**: Does adding stress and anxiety metrics improve the prediction of depression compared to demographic and academic variables alone?  
**Insights**:
Including stress and anxiety as predictors significantly enhances the depression model's performance and provides a more accurate prediction of depression levels.

## Tools and Methodsüõ†Ô∏è 

1. **Bayesian Models**:
   - Built and estimated using Stan with MCMC sampling.
   - Models include hierarchical structures to account for variability across individuals.

2. **Model Evaluation**:
   - **Prior Predictive Checks**: Ensure reasonable assumptions before running models.

## üìä Key Insights
1. **Gender**:
   - Women have significantly higher depression levels than men.
2. **Stress and Anxiety**:
   - Younger students and those in advanced years are more prone to stress and anxiety.
   - Engineering students report lower levels of these variables compared to non-engineering students.
3. **Depression Prediction**:
   - Models that include stress and anxiety metrics perform better than those relying solely on demographics.
